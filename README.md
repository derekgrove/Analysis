ongoing work with coffea (columnar analysis), the initial commit will have files that I wrote on the SWAN computing environment through CERN so all my directories are relative to the eos space on lxplus.
This will change with time as I transition to working locally with these files (and as I learn more techniques for fetching NanoAOD files directly from CMS DAS).
